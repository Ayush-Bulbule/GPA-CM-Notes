# ■ The categories of built-in data types in Python are:
# ■ Binary Types – bytes, memory view, bytearray
# ■ Mapping Type – dict

# ■ Text Type – str
# ■ Boolean Type – bool
# ■ Set Types – set, frozenset
# ■ Sequence Types – list, range, tuple

# Byte:
x = b"Bytes objects are immutable sequences of single bytes"
print(f"The Value of x is {x} and type {type(x)}")

num = 24
print(f"The Value of num is {num} and type {type(num)}")

num1 = 26.4534
print("The Value of num1 is {num1} and type {type(num1)}")
